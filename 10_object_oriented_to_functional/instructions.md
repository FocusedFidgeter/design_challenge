## Change object-oriented code into functional

The debate over functional vs object-oriented programming has been ongoing for decades, and both paradigms have their
proponents and detractors. At a high level, object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that models
real-world objects and their relationships, while functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that focuses
on the evaluation of functions and their application to data.
