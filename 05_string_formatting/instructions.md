## String formatting

String formatting is a way of constructing a string that includes dynamic or variable values. It allows you to insert
values into a string and control how those values are displayed. You can use string formatting to replace placeholders
in a string with actual values, such as numbers or strings, and also specify how those values should be formatted.
This can help make your code more readable and easier to maintain, especially when you need to output complex or
formatted strings. In Python, there are different ways to perform string formatting, including using the % operator,
the format() method, or f-strings.

## Challenge

For this challenge you need to modify (all) the strings that are printed so that they look better and are easier to read. You
can use either the format() method of f-strings, or a combination of both.
