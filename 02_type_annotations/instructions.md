## Add type hinting

Type hinting in Python is important because it allows developers to explicitly specify the data types of
function parameters and return values. This helps to improve code clarity, readability, and maintainability,
especially in large-scale projects where multiple developers may be working on the same codebase.
By using type hinting, developers can catch potential bugs early on in the development process, and also
help IDEs provide better code suggestions and error detection.

Although, python is quite permissive as a language and will allow variables of different types to be passed it is
one of the best practices to use type hinting for the reasons named above.

## Challenge

For this challenge, you will need to type hint the code given in `app.py` file. Keep in mind that since the dataclasses
have no type hinting, which is mandatory the code can't run.
