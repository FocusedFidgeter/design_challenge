## Replace complex function with itertools / custom iterator

Python has excellent built in libraries that can simplify many process without you having to 
re-invent the wheel every time.


## Challenge

For this challenge you need to refactor the `calculate_sensor_averages` function in the `application.py`
to use the `itertools` library functionality to perfor the exact same operation.

This operation is calculating the average value of every sensor across all devices.
