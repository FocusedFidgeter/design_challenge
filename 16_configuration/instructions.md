## Add configuration file to store all external parameters 

A configuration file allows you to store settings or parameters separately from the code. This makes it easier to 
modify or manage these settings without changing the code itself, and also allows you to use the same code with 
different configurations, easier than when you need to find that value in the code itself.


## Challenge

For this challenge you need to modify the weather app to parse (and compose) the parameters it needs for successfully 
calling the `OpenWeatherMap` api. By the end of the challenge, when you need to run for another city or using a 
different api key, you should only modify the configuration file.
